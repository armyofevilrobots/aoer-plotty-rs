ArmyOfEvilRobots pen-plotter art related tools and libraries

This library contains a variety of tools used to make pen-plotter based art.
While it focuses on a combination of nannou and geo/geo_types for now, it
will likely expand into other areas as I find the need for my own creations.
Based (extremely roughly) on [`shapely`] for Python for the geographic
functions, with a splash of [`VSK`].

*CAUTION: This isn't even Alpha quality yet, and I am poking away at it on
my days off. May spontaneously explode, might take your plotter with it.*
